<div>
  <h3>MainComponent</h3>
  <p>Each Component consists of the 3 separate files (4 if you include the spec file for testing) 
    and usually included in a folder named after the component's name used in creation. The initial 
    component is the AppComponent (in the app folder), a new component called Task would be in the 
    TaskComponent (in a new folder called task, generated by the CLI for us, assuming we used the 
    cli in the following approach ng generate component task).    
    The AppComponent will always load (as the initial component), but every other component we make, 
    we can have it load within the AppComponent's HTML template by using its selector. If we create 
    a new component with the CLI: ng generate component task we will see that folder, and it's files 
    generated inside the app folder. These are the same files generated for AppComponent (as just 
    mentioned above), but now they represent the TaskComponent. Here is what that set looks like, 
    inside the Task folder structure</p>
